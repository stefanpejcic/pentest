# Pentest
Penetration testing of apps & services that I work daily on (CF, WP, Apache, IIS, Lucee, etc..)

### WordPress
Classic exploits including bruteforce, spamming, xss, etc..

</ul>

### IIS
Slowloris attacks don't stand a chance on Windows Servers due to the default 5000 connections setting IIS has -Just generating the sockets alone is going to take hours.. Therefore we can use the classic ddos method of sending thousands of packages per secound.. Works well with proxy!

</ul>

### Apache
On Linux machines (tested on ubuntu 18.04) Apache is vulnerable to the slowloris attack, and by keeping the connection alive every 15s you can produce a full scale ddos attack from a single machine with 200 sockets (apache default max-workers).

</ul>

### ColdFusion
ColdFusion versions prior to 2016 are all vulnerable in their own way.. Applications on it are bloated and use outdated libraries that have thousands of vulnerabilities in them.
